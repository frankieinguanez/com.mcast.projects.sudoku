    "- Consider larger datasets from other sources such as on Kaggle (Horizonal growth - scope)\n",
    "- Implement a Sudoku Generator (Horizonal growth - scope)\n",
    "- Generate a balanced dataset (equal number of grids per unknowns/clues) (Horizonal growth - scope)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prototype\n",
    "- Register valid steps taken in solving (Vertical growth - market readiness)\n",
    "- Add a UI/frontend to interact and visualise (Vertical growth - market readiness)\n",
    "- Implement other solution algorithms (Depth growth - technical rigour)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain\n",
    "- Migrate to other problems like Chess, Go (Domain change)"
